{
	/// <summary>
	/// A collection that maps new objects to old, equivalent versions of the
	/// same objects. It is typically used with LINQ during a Computed update.
	/// </summary>
	/// <typeparam name="T">Type of object to recycle. When using the MVVM design
	/// pattern, T is typically a type of view-model that wraps around a model
	/// type.</typeparam>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This class helps implement the MVVM pattern with Assisticant. In this
	/// pattern, you typically write a "Model" class which contains all the state
	/// information for your models, and a "ViewModel" class which is a thin 
	/// wrapper around the Model. The ViewModel should be stateless, except for
	/// temporary information that is only meaningful in the GUI, such as an 
	/// "IsSelected" flag that represents whether the ViewModel is selected in
	/// a ListBox.
	/// <para/>
	/// In the Assisticant paradigm, you will typically create (at most) one
	/// ViewModel object for each Model, and some kind of computed collection is 
	/// used to keep the set of ViewModels synchronized with the set of Models. 
	/// RecycleBin plays an important role in this paradigm. If you use a class 
	/// such as <see cref="ComputedList{T}"/>, it will use a RecycleBin for you,
	/// but if you use <see cref="Computed"/> directly then you may need to 
	/// create a RecycleBin yourself.
	/// <para/>
	/// RecycleBin has two purposes: (1) it disposes old objects that are no 
	/// longer in use, if T implements IDisposable; and (2) it preserves any state 
	/// information in the ViewModel wrappers.
	/// <para/>
	/// Typical usage is as follows: you first construct a RecycleBin within a 
	/// <see cref="Computed"/>'s update function (assuming that the Computed 
	/// controls a collection.) You fill the recycle bin with the old contents 
	/// of your collection of ViewModels, then construct a new collection of 
	/// ViewModels (from scratch, e.g. using a LINQ query over your models), and 
	/// pass each new ViewModel through the <see cref="Extract(T)"/> method. If 
	/// the new ViewModel represents a Model that was in the old collection, 
	/// Extract returns the old ViewModel; otherwise it returns the new ViewModel.
	/// This ensures that the ViewModel state is preserved. For example, if your 
	/// ViewModel has an IsSelected flag, then failing to use a RecycleBin would 
	/// cause any selected objects to become deselected whenever the Computed 
	/// is updated (assuming IsSelected is false by default).
	/// <para/>
	/// The recycle bin extracts objects based on a prototype. If
	/// the recycle bin contains an object matching the prototype
	/// according to <see cref="Object.GetHashCode"/> and
	/// <see cref="Object.Equals(object)"/>, then that matching object
	/// is extracted. If not, the prototype itself is used. It is
	/// imperitive that you properly implement GetHashCode and
	/// Equals in your recycled classes.
	/// <para/>
	/// If T is a ViewModel class, then it generally suffices for T.GetHashCode 
	/// to call GetHashCode on the wrapped Model, and for T.Equals to compare
	/// the two wrapped objects for equality.
	/// <para/>
	/// In general, your implementation of GetHashCode and Equals must only 
	/// consider fields that do not change. If a field can be changed, or is
	/// itself computed, then it must not be used either as part of the
	/// hash code, or to determine equality. The best practice is to
	/// implement GetHashCode and Equals in terms of fields that are
	/// initialized by the constructor, and are thereafter immutable.
	/// <para/>
	/// The advantage of RecycleBin is not found in any time or memory savings.
	/// In fact, using RecycleBin in most cases adds a small amount of overhead.
	/// However, the advantage comes from preserving the dynamic and
	/// computed state of the recycled objects. If your depenent collection
	/// contains only immutable objects (such as strings), there is no
	/// advantage to using a RecycleBin.
	/// </remarks>
